Replaces unencrypted passwords with encrypted passwords using an RSA key
pair.

A separate encryption script & key can produce encrypted passwords that
cannot be decrypted without the private key.  The private key is encoded
into the FDW's binary file.

After you patch your FDWs, using unencrypted passwords will no longer
work.  This patch uses the standard password field for storing the
encrypted password.  The existing password field must contain a much
longer encrypted password instead of a plain text one.



# Run:
mkdir ~/fdw_pass
cd ~/fdw_pass
git clone https://github.com/pgstuff/encrypted_fdw_passwords.git
cd encrypted_fdw_passwords/fdw_private_key
./fdw_new_key_pair.sh

# Run:
pg_config

# If pg_config is not found, run:
locate bin/pg_config
# And add it to your path with (adjust as necessary):
export PATH=/usr/pgsql-9.6/bin:$PATH

cd ~/fdw_pass
git clone git://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git
cd postgresql
git checkout tags/REL9_6_0
./configure
# If configure fails, install the necessary packages.
make world
# make will take a while.
cd contrib/postgres_fdw
make clean
make
# If the make command works, then the patch is ready.

make clean
make
sudo make install
# If the install is not pointing in the correct location, you can copy
# the file postgres_fdw.so manually.
sudo cp -p /usr/local/pgsql/lib/postgres_fdw.so /usr/pgsql-9.6/lib/postgres_fdw.so

cd ~/fdw_pass/encrypted_fdw_passwords/fdw_encrypt_password
./fdw_encrypt.sh
# Enter the password.  The password will be echo'ed as you type.
# If you are confident about your copy and paste accuracy or typing
# skills and do not want the passwords displayed, add -s to the read
# command in the shell script.  Note that you may not get a friendly
# error if the password is incorrect.
# Paste the encrypted password into the FDW's password field.
# The output of the script can also be piped to a file.
# It is safe to distribute the two files in the fdw_encrypt_password
# directory so that anyone can produce encrypted passwords.
# The password cannot be decrypted using those files.

Note: It is assumed that the your environment has already compiled these
FDWs before.  The dependencies of these FDWs, such as native clients,
are not covered here.
