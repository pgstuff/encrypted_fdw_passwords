Replaces unencrypted passwords with encrypted passwords using an RSA key
pair.

After you patch your FDWs, using unencrypted password will no longer
work.  This patch uses the standard password field for storing the
encrypted password.  The existing password field will contain a much
longer encrypted password instead of a plain text one.



# Run:
mkdir ~/fdw_pass
cd ~/fdw_pass
git clone https://github.com/pgstuff/encrypted_fdw_passwords.git
cd encrypted_fdw_passwords/fdw_private_key
bash fdw_new_key_pair.sh

# Edit the patches in ../fdw_patches/*_fdw-*-rsa_password.patch
# Replace the privateKeyB64B64ShiftedB64Shifted string with the key that
# was just printed.
# The line should start with:
#   char *privateKeyB64B64ShiftedB64Shifted = "
# And end with:
#   ";
# Make sure that there are no spaces between the "'s.
# Run bash fdw_private_key_encode_c.sh if you need to copy and paste the
# key again.

# Run:
pg_config

# If pg_config is not found, run:
locate bin/pg_config
# And add it to your path with (adjust as necessary):
export PATH=/usr/local/pgsql/bin:$PATH

cd ~/fdw_pass
git clone git://git.postgresql.org/git/postgresql.git
cd postgresql
git checkout tags/REL9_5_0
./configure
# If configure fails, install the necessary packages.
make world
# make will take a while.
cd contrib/postgres_fdw
make clean
make
# If the make command works, then the patch is ready.
patch < ~/fdw_pass/encrypted_fdw_passwords/fdw_patches/postgres_fdw-REL9_5_0-rsa_password.patch
# If you forgot to edit the patch, then replace the key in the file
# connection.c (privateKeyB64B64ShiftedB64Shifted)
make
sudo make install
# If the install is not pointing in the correct location, you can copy
# the file postgres_fdw.so manually.

cd ~/fdw_pass/encrypted_fdw_passwords/fdw_encrypt_password
bash fdw_encrypt.sh
# Enter the password.  The password will be echo'ed as you type.
# If you are confident about your copy and paste accuracy or typing
# skills and do not want the passwords displayed, add -s to the read
# command in the shell script.  Note that you may not get a friendly
# error if the password is incorrect.
# Paste the encrypted password into the FDW's password field.
# It is safe to distribute the two files in the fdw_encrypt_password
# directory so that anyone can produce encrypted passwords.
# The password cannot be decrypted using those files.

Note: It is assumed that the your environment has already compiled these
FDWs before.  The dependencies of these FDWs, such as native clients,
are not covered here.
